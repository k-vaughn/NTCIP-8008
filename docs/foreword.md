# Foreword

## Overview

This document is an NTCIP Open-Source Experimental Specification for an NTCIP
Process, Control, and Information Management document.

Open-source documents are developed using the ITS Open-Source Process, as
defined in NTCIP X8008. This process provides an open standards development
process that accepts issues reported by the community and resolved by
peer-reviewed contributions from the community. The open source process
concludes with the resultant material being approved by the defined approval
process.

Experimental specifications are approved through a streamlined process focused
on the technical experts of the community (e.g., those participating in the
open-source development process) rather than through a formal ballot of industry
managers.

NTCIP Process, Control, and Information Management documents define the
practices and policies used by the NTCIP Joint Committee and its working groups
in developing and maintaining NTCIP publications.

This document defines the process for developing projects for the ITS community
using an open-source environment (e.g., GitHub). The project can produce any
type of product, such as a guide, a technical specification, a test procedure
(e.g., including code), etc.

The approval process for the resultant open-source product is based on the
target level of specification. For example, an experimental specification
undergoes a less formal approval process than a full standard.

## Approvals

Experimental specifications are peer reviewed within the open-source process
with final approval by an associated WG established by the NTCIP Joint
Committee.

Approval information is provided within the online environment.

## User Comment Instructions

Comments can be submitted at any time. In preparation of this NTCIP standards
publication, input of users and other interested parties was sought and
evaluated.

Comments on open-source projects can be submitted either on the
[discussions](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/discussions)
or [issues](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/issues) tab of the
project.

Discussions can be initiated at any time and anyone in the community can
respond, all within a public environment. Responses to discussion comments are
strictly informative and may not be accurate. Discussion comments can lead to
the submittal of issues that need to be resolved to clarify the standard.

Issues can be submitted at any time. Issues are triaged by the project
maintainer, who will evaluate their merit, classify them (e.g., as a bug,
documentation issue, ommission), and in most cases respond to the submitter.
Once ready, issues will be available for contributors to volunteer to address.
When a volunteer has a proposed solution, it can be submitted to the project and
approved in a relatively short period (when compared to the traditional
standards approval process). However, updates to the projects are still version
controlled so that users can reference a specific version of the project without
fear of it changing.

Comment should use the templates provided on the website; otherwise they may be ignored.

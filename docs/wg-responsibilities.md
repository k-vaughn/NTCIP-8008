# WG Responsibilities {.body}

## Overview {.body}

Each major stage of the open-source process is reviewed by a WG or committee to
ensure a base level of consensus. The specific group that is required to provide
consensus and the level of consensus required dependent upon the standardization
path adopted for the project.

!!! example
    An NTCIP experimental specification can be approved at the NTCIP WG
    level for all stages while an NTCIP standard requires Joint Committee
    approval for the project approval and release approval.

The stages within the open-source process include:

- project approval
- issue prioritization
- pull-request approval
- release approval

## Project Approval {.body}

An appropriate WG or committee **shall** approve the formation of a project
prior to establishing the SDO GitHub repository for the project.

The appropriate WG or committee **should** be identified in policies adopted by
any SDO adopting the ITS Open-Source Process.

!!! note
    A contributor can establish their own GitHub repository for the project
    before formal approval to allow WG members to gain a better idea of what is
    being proposed.

!!! example "NTCIP Guidance"
    NTCIP 8001 identifies the appropriate WG or committee for NTCIP open-source projects.

## Issue Prioritization {.body}

A WG **should** oversee the prioritization of significant issues for each of its
open-source projects.

A WG **may** provide guidance to its maintainer as to what constitutes a
significant issue and how various issues should be handled.

!!! note
    Many issues can be prioritized by the maintainer without involving the WG;
    however, when major issues arise that affect the direction of the project,
    it is best to obtain direction from the WG to ensure resoures are managed
    properly.

## Pull-Request Approval {.body}

The WG responsible for the open-source project **shall** approve each pull
request prior to its merge into the SDO repository.

The WG responsible for the open-source project **shall** establish its policies
on what constitutes a pull-request approval.

!!! note
    A pull-request approval typically requires simple majority with no sustained
    objections.

!!! example "GitHub Guidance"
    This can be achieved by requiring a minimum number of approvals within GitHub
    among a designated set of voting members.

## Approve Releases {.body}

The WG responsible for the open-source project **shall** approve each version of
a project prior to it being tagged as a release.

The WG responsible for the open-source project **shall** establish its policies
on what constitutes a release approval.

!!! example
    A release approval can be as simple as WG consensus or can require a formal
    ballot according to the processes adopted by the full committee.

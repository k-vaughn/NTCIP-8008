# Maintainer Responsibilities {.body}

## Overview {.body}

The maintainer for an open-source project fulfills many responsibilities,
including setting up the project, managing issues, reviewing submittals, and
leading the development community. In addition, the maintainer is often a
prime contributor.

## Establish Repository {.body}

The maintainer **shall** work with the sponsoring SDO to establish the
open-source repository for the project.

!!! example

    NTCIP repositories are hosted at[https://github.com/ite-org/](https://github.com/ite-org/).

## Configure Project Settings {.body}

### Issues and Discussions {.body}

The maintainer **shall** ensure that the issues and discussion pages are enabled
for the ITS open-source project.

!!! note
    Within GitHub, issues are enabled by default but the discussions tab is
    disabled. To enable, go to the settings tab and select discussions in the
    general section.

### Pages {.body}

If the project includes documentation, the maintainer **shall** ensure that
GitHub pages is enabled for the project.

!!! note "GitHub Process"
    To activate GitHub Pages using MkDocs, create a gh-pages branch. The go to
    the settings tab and select pages from the left-hand menu. Set Source to
    "deploy from a branch" and then select the "gh-pages" branch and the /root directory.

### Dependabot {.body}

If the project includes code, the maintainer **may** configure Dependabot to
report issues or create pull requests to update dependencies with security vulnerabilities.

!!! note
    Dependabot is a GitHub feature that monitors the project's dependencies and
    reports any possible security vulnerabilities. To learn more about this feature,
    please read through the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide).

## Set Up Project Files {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### Overview {.body}

The maintainer **shall** ensure the following files are provided in the
repository when starting the project and maintained throughout the project:

- README.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE.md
- SECURITY.md
- .github/CODEOWNERS
- appropriate issue templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
- appropriate PR temapltes in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
- appropriate saved replies

Additionally, if the site includes documentation, the maintainer **shall**
ensure the following files are provided in the repository when starting the
project and maintained throughout the project:

- .gitignore
- mkdocs.yml
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml (generates the documentation)
- docs/index.md
- docs/stylesheets/extra.css
- overrides/main.html (adds a status badge to the page)
- overrides/partials/nav.html (changes the naviation heading to be "Contents")
- overrides/partials/toc.html (changes TOC heading to be the document name)

Finally, the site **shall** include installation guidance, which **may** be
contained in the README.md file, a separate INSTALLATION.md file, or in project
documentation.

!!! note "GitHub Help"
    A template repository containing all of these files, which can be used to
    initialize new projects, is stored on the [ITE GitHub Site](https://github.com/ite-org/open-source-template).

### Readme.md File {.body}

The README.md file **shall** contain an introduction to the open-source project.
A good readme file should be clear, concise, up-to-date, and detailed. This file
is located in your root directory and is displayed as the homepage of the
repository within GitHub.

The README.md file **shall** contain the following information:

- project title
- information on how to access the current documentation for the project
- information on how to access prior releases of the project
- project summary, including its status and overview
- Acknowledgements of relevant funding sources, sponsors, and other open-source projects
- installation guidance
- tech and tools used in the project
- link to the code of conduct
- link to discussion forum for the project
- link to the issues page for the project and the types of issues accepted for
the project
- link to the contributing guidelines
- link to the open source license

!!! note
    A README file is written in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
    language, a popular language used in open source documentation like READMEs.
    The readme file does not use any of the special codes introduced by MkDocs or
    Materials for MkDocs.

!!! example "Examples of good README files"

- [OpenSauced App](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/README.md)
- [Astro documentation](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/README.md)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/README.md)
- [ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/README.md)

### Installation Guidance {.body}

The installation guidance **may** be contained within the README.md file (e.g.,
if it is simple), be a separate file, or reference a section within the project documentation.

This guide identifies the tools and technology used by the project and includes
instructions for the following:

- forking the repository
- cloning the repository
- installing the dependencies
- setting up the environment variables
- setting up the database, if applicable
- running the project locally

The best way to test your guide is by setting up the project locally using your guide.
If you encounter issues getting your project to work, you will discover it quickly
and can update the documentation to add or clarify the missing piece.

!!! example
    [OpenSauced Contributing Guidelines](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)

### Code of Conduct File {.body}

The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file **shall** define the rules and behaviors that are to
be followed for the project.

The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file **should** consist of a reference to the [ITS Open-Source
Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) with any exceptions and extensions identified.

!!! note
    It is expected that exceptions and extensions to the code of conduct will be
    rare.

### Contributing File {.body}

The CONTRIBUTING.md file **shall** define the rules for contributing to the project.

The CONTRIBUTING.md file **should** consist of a reference to the
[ITS Open-Source Contributor Responsibilities](contributor-responsibilities.md)
with any exceptions and extensions identified.

The CONTRIBUTING.md file **should** identify specific types of conventions that
apply to the project.

!!! example
    The ITS Open-Source Process project only has documentation and while the resulting
    specification discusses coding conventions, the project does not include any
    code, ASN.1 or MIBs.

!!! note
    Areas where exceptions and extensions are expected to occur include:

    - documentation conventions (e.g., extensions for consistency in presenting
    project-specific information),
    - coding conventions (e.g., for languages not discussed in the ITE Open Source
    Process documentation, special naming conventions),
    - testing and linting requirements
    - the process to claim ownership pf issues (e.g., WG approvals),
    - guidelines for commit conventions
    - requirements for creating pull requests (e.g., fields that need to be included),
      and
    - requirements for pull requests to be approved (e.g., WG approvals)

### License File {.body}

!!! quote "Per [The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/)"
    Making your GitHub project public is not the same as licensing your project.
    Public projects are covered by [GitHub’s Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants),
    which allows others to view and fork your project, but your work otherwise
    comes with no permissions.

    If you want others to use, distribute, modify, or contribute back to your project,
    you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally
    use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it’s public, unless
    you explicitly give them the right to do so.

The LICENSE file **shall** be a well-known Free and Open Source license.

For NTCIP documentation projects, including standards and ASN.1, the license **should**
be [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

!!! note
    The CC BY license is designed for documentation and other creative works where
    uers are allowed to use, distribute, modify, and contribute but any derivative
    works are required to give attribution to the source of the material and cannot
    "implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship, or
    endorsement by the licensor."

For NTCIP projects involving code for a computer program, the license **should**
be the [Gnu Lesser General Public License Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).

!!! note
    The LGPL v3 license is designed for compilable software that runs on a machine.
    Like the CC BY license, it allows uers to use, distribute, modify, and contribute
    material as long as they give attribution to the original source and does not
    provide any rights to the names, trademarks, or logos of the original source.

### Security file {.body}

The SECURITY.md file **shall** indicate how to provide reports of security issues
through private channels to prevent exposure of the vulnerabilities prior to
their fix.

### Code Owners File {.body}

The .github/CODEOWNERS file **shall** conform to the rules defined in the
[official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

!!! note
   This ensures that the correct maintainers are notified when PRs are submitted.

!!! example
    By opting-in to "require approval" and "require review from code owners", a
    WG can require a majority of voting members of the WG to approve any pull request
    before it can be merged into the protected branch. This can reduce the chance
    of merging pull requests that can break production.

### Issue Templates {.body}

The maintainer **shall** define appropriate issue forms.

The maintainer **shall** develop the forms using YAML per the
[GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms).

!!! note
    Issue forms allow the maintainer to ensure commenters provide key information
    (or at least provide text for specific fields) when they report issues making
    the triage process, and the review of pull requests easier to perform. Additionally,
    future contributors can benefit from these templates by understanding the history
    of changes made, which can help them debug or understand the code involved.

    You can create various issue forms, such as bug reports, feature requests,
    documentation updates, etc. Each form can specify which fields are required,
    such as the steps for reproducing the bug or a details section for a feature
    request. The form can also be designed to automatically attach specific labels
    like`feature`, `needs triage`, or `bug` to quickly identify the type of issue.

!!! example
    [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation_bug.yml`](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation_bug.yml)
    or [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation_enhancement.yml`](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation_enhancement.yml)

### Pull Request Templates {.body}

The maintainer **shall** define appropriate pull request templates.

!!! note
    GitHub currently only supports markdown templates for pull requests rather
    than YAML forms. Nonetheless, the templates serve a similar purpose in that
    they guide contributors in providing specific and structured information when
    opening pull requests in your project.

!!! example
    [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/tree/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

!!! tip
    You can learn more about [creating a pull request template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
    on the official GitHub documentation.

![PR template example](_assets/images/pr-template.png)

### Saved Replies {.body}

Sometimes, you repeatedly write the same reply to issues or pull requests. Clear
communication between maintainers and contributors is crucial. So, when you write
all comments manually, your messages will no longer be consistent and may be unclear.
You can create saved replies when you frequently respond to issues and pull requests
with the same comments.

[Saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/about-saved-replies)
allow you to create a reusable response to issues, pull requests, and discussions
and use it across repositories. It will save you time responding to contributors
while keeping the consistency of your message. You can always modify your replies
if necessary.

Read the GitHub documentation for complete instructions about how to
[create saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/creating-a-saved-reply).

![Saved replies gif](_assets/gifs/saved-replies.gif)

### Gitignore File {.body}

If there are any files that are likely to exist within the project directory
that should not become a part of the repository, the maintainer **shall**
include a `.gitignore` file.

!!! example
    Projects that include documentation that is based on MkDocs typically have
    a `site` directory generated by MkDocs as a part of the process to generate
    a static website for review. This directory is not intended to be part of
    the registry as GitHub will produce its own generated site. In this case,
    the project is to include a `.gitignore` file that contains the line "site/",
    as for this [project](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/.gitignore).

### Mkdocs.yml File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `mkdocs.yml` file.

!!! note
    The mkdocs.yml file defines directives to the mkdocs engine when generating
    the static website. For example, it defines

    - name of the site,
    - URL of the site,
    - navigation menu,
    - theme,
    - extensions/plugins used, and
    - other details

!!! example
    [Mkdocs file for ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/mkdocs.yml)

### Deploy.yml File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file that deploys the MkDocs site to
GitHub Pages.

!!! note
    The deploy.yml file can be used to automate actions when pull requests are
    merged with the project. For example, for projects that use MkDocs, the
    deploy file can ensure that the GitHub Pages site is updated with the new
    material when a pull request is merged.

!!! example
    [Deploy file for ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

### Index File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `docs/index.md` file that provides a cover page for the document.

### Extra.css File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `docs/stylesheets/extra.css` file that defines the heading styles to
be used for the body and the annexes (i.e., adding setion numbers in front of
headings).

The maintainer **shall** ensure that this badge only changes per the approval
process defined for the project.

### Main.html File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `overrides/main.html` file that provides a badge that identifies the
status of the project files.

The maintainer **shall** ensure that this badge only changes per the approval
process defined for the project.

!!! note
    By default, MkDocs does not display a status badge. Adding this badge
    ensures that users are aware of the status of the material located on the
    page.

!!! example
    [Main.html file for ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/overrides/main.html)

### Nav.html File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `overrides/partials/nav.html` file that overrides the title assigned
to the left-hand navigation menu to be "Contents".

!!! note
    By default, MkDocs entitles the left hand navigation (i.e., navigation of
    pages) with the title of the site. To better align with NTCIP formats, the
    nav.html file is provided to change this to "Contents".

!!! example
    [Nav.html file for ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/overrides/partials/nav.html)

### Toc.html File {.body}

If the project includes documentation using MkDocs, the maintainer **shall**
define a `overrides/partials/toc.html` file that overrides the title assigned
to the navigation menu on the right side of the screen.

!!! note
    By default, MkDocs entitles the right-hand navigation (i.e., the contents of
    the current page) as "Contents". To better align with NTCIP formats, the
    standard toc.html file changes this to the title of the current page.

!!! example
    [Toc.html file for ITS Open-Source Process](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source/blob/main/overrides/partials/toc.html)

## Define Project Structure {.body}

Once the project is established, configured, and the loaded with the initial
project files, the maintainer **shall** establish the plan for the project by
defining issues along with any appropriate stub files that can provide further
guidance.

!!! note
    This includes defining the plan for all aspects of the project (e.g.,
    documentation and code).

## Issue Triage {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### Overview {.body}

Once issues are being created for the project, the maintainer will need to
triage these issues to ensure that they contribute to the project plan and so
that they can be claimed by contributors.

Learning to triage issues is essential for any open-source maintainer. This
involves going through the existing list of open issues and prioritizing them
in order of importance. Some open issues will be critical bug fixes, while others
might be nice to have feature requests. Sometimes, you might have issues opened
for things that are not a right fit for the project.

### Triage Pre-Assessment {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
#### Overview {.body}

Prior to performing any detailed triage, it is important to screen reported issues
that are not appropriate for further investigation.

#### Dealing with Spam {.body}

When a comment is spam, clearly combative, or unhelpful, the maintainer **should**
avoid direct engagement, label the issue as `spam`, close the issue, and move on.

!!! example
    This project is terrible! Nothing works, and your code is garbage. I can't
    believe anyone would use this. Fix it ASAP!!!

#### Insufficient Information Issues {.body}

When a comment does not provide concrete details about the issue, the maintainer
**should** respond by requesting more information.

!!! example
    If it is a bug report, ask for more details on reproducing it. If it is a
    feature request, ask for clarification on style or functionality changes.

If the commenter does not respond within a week, the maintainer **should** message
them again for more details.

If a few weeks pass and the issue is not considered critical, the maintainer
**may** close the issue.

#### Stale Issues {.body}

The maintainer **may** may label issues that have not been worked on for months
as `stale`.

!!! example
    An issue reported on a portion of a project that has been significantly
    edited by other contributions.

If the maintainer wishes to resurrect a `stale` issue, the maintainer **shall**
go through the normal triage process, including adding and removing labels as appropriate.

If the maintainer believes a `stale` issue no longer applies, the maintainer
**should** close the issue. This process **may** be automated (e.g., using an
action like [Close Stale Issues and PRs](https://github.com/actions/stale).

#### Ensuring Proper categorization {.body}

For issues that have sufficient information and are not `spam` or `stale`, the
maintainer **shall** add and/or remove labels as appropriate for proper management.

!!! note
    Most ITS standardization projects are expected to have a small number of
    contributors, in which case, the following set of labels are generally
    appropriate. Projects with more contributors should consider a fuller range
    of labels as adopted by the open-source community.

The following labels **should** be considered for most specification projects:

1. General Type Labels

    - **github automation:** an issue related to the automated github scripts in
   testing or generating the documentation.
    - **question:** Indicates a general inquiry or a request for clarification about
   how something works. Questions should be moved to the discussion tab, but the
   issue can be labeled with `question` and closed.

2. Type Labels for Documentation

    - **documentation bug:** Identifies a reported problem or flaw in the documentation.
    - **documentation enhancement:** Refers to a suggestion or request to improve
   or add informative text in the documentation.
    - **new user need:** Suggests a new user need to be added in the document.
    - **user need modification:** Suggests a modification to a user need in the document.
    - **new requirement:** Suggests a new requirement to be added in the document.
    - **requirement modification:** Suggests a modification to a requirement in
   the document.
    - **dialog modification:** Suggests a modification to a dialog in the document.
    - **ASN.1 modification:** A change to the ASN.1 or MIB.

3. Type Labels for Code
    - **bug:** Identifies a reported problem, flaw, or unexpected behavior in the
    code.
    - **enhancement:** Refers to a suggestion or request to improve or add
    features to the project.
    - **feature:** Used for issues proposing new functionality or significant changes.
    - **refactor:** A change in the codebase that improves its structure or
    readability without altering its functionality.
    - **test:** Issues related to unit tests, integration tests, or overall
    testing improvements.
4. Priority Labels (Help prioritize issues based on urgency or importance)
    - **critical:** Indicates urgent issue related to an existing release that
    needs to be addressed immediately (e.g., perhaps requiring its own release
    to formalize in a timely manner).
    - **high priority:** Indicates urgent issue that needs to be addressed as
    soon as possible to allow for other tasks to proceed  for the current
    update but not critical.
    - **medium priority:** Important issue to address prior to next release that
    relates to functionality but not high priority.
    - **low priority:** Non-urgent issues that may be tackled if there’s extra
    time or resources available.
5. Status Labels (Track the progress of an issue or pull request)
    - **in progress:** The issue is currently being worked on.
    - **blocked:** Work on this issue is delayed or cannot proceed due to a
    dependency or external factor.
    - **needs discussion:** Indicates that the issue or pull request requires
    further conversation or clarification before proceeding.
    - **triage:** Newly created issues that need to be reviewed, categorized,
    and prioritized.
    - **ready for review:** The pull request is awaiting review by project maintainers.
    - **duplicate:** Marks an issue as being identical or closely related to an
    already existing issue.
    - **wontfix:** Indicates that the maintainers have decided not to address
    the issue, either due to scope, relevance, or priority.
6. Difficulty or Effort Labels (Classify the expected effort required to
address the issue)
    - **good first issue:** Meant for new contributors; these are usually
    easy-to-solve problems with clear instructions.
    - **beginner-friendly:** Similar to “good first issue,” these are relatively
    simple problems that beginners can address.
    - **help wanted:** Indicates that maintainers need assistance with the issue,
    open to contributions.
    - **complex:** Issues that are challenging, requiring significant experience
    or effort to resolve.
7. Version or Milestone Labels (Track issues by release or milestone)
    - **compatibility:** Associates an issue or pull request with a specific
    version or release milestone.
    - **next release:** Indicates that the issue is planned for inclusion in the
    upcoming release.
    - **future:** Refers to issues or features planned for future releases
    beyond the current roadmap.

### Triaging Bugs {.body}

The maintainer **should** verify the existance of any reported bug.

!!! note
    If the maintainer expects to assign the issue to himself, the verification
    step can be postponed until the action is undertaken to correct the bug. If
    the bug cannot be verified, reply to the issue's original poster to gain
    more information and context.

### Triaging Feature Requests {.body}

The maintainer **shall** ensure that any new feature request fits into the
vision for the project.

The maintainer **shall** communicate with the original poster of the issue to
determine how to best deal with the issue, including:

- assigning to the originator, if they express a willingness to contribute a solution,
- assigning to the originator and someone else (e.g., a maintainer), if the
originator is willing to contribute to a solution but is unwilling to develop
and propose it,
- adding a `help wanted`, if the maintainer wishes to look for another
contributor, or
- assigning it to himself or another core team member, if the maintainer
expects the issue to be addressed by them in a timely manner.

!!! note
    Complex issues are best assigned to core team members.

### Triaging Duplicate Issues {.body}

When assigning a `duplicate` label, the maintainer **should** respond  to the
originator of the issue.

!!! example
    Thank you for taking the time to open this issue. Another team member is
    working on this feature, which will be added soon. As a result, we are
    going to close this issue.

### Triaging Rejected Issues {.body}

When assigning a `wontfix` label, the maintainer **should** respond  to the
originator of the issue.

!!! example
    Thank you for being so interested in our project. The feature you have
    proposed would not be a good fit for this project's current scope and
    direction. At this time, we will not be moving forward with this feature.

## Reviewing Pull Requests {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### Overview {.body}

It is the maintainer's responsibility to ensure that the suggested code or
documentation update meets the standards of the project and doesn't introduce
any new issues for the project. You will also need to work with the contributor
to help solve issues they encounter.

### Pull-Request Pre-Assessment {.body}

#### Spam Pull Requests {.body}

For any pull request deemed to be spam, the maintainer **should** label the
request as `spam`, close the pull request, and not respond to the contributor.

!!! example

- whitespace changes to the README file or other files
- random changes to files without an accompanying issue or explanation
- numerous links to unrelated websites or promotes products/services
- plagiarized content from other sources without permission or proper attribution

#### Low-Quality Pull Requests {.body}

For a pull request deemed to be of low quality, the maintainer **should** reach
out to the author, explaining what needs to be added and what changes need to
be made.

!!! example

- unfinished pull requests that do not address the entire issue
- code that does not fit within the established style guide for the project
- incomplete pull request forms that do not provide sufficient information on
what changes were made
- address multiple issues at once and make it challenging to review

!!! note

    Most of the time, low-quality pull requests are due to contributors not
    being aware of the rules to follow and need extra explanation and time to
    improve their pull requests.

#### Stale Pull Requests {.body}

If the maintainer is unable to get a response from a contributor regarding an
issue after a repeated attempts over several weeks, the maintainer **may**
reassign the associated issue; if there is an associated pending pull request,
the maintainer **shall** either close the pull request or take it over (i.e.,
by using the code in the pull request as the starting point for additional
modifications).

### Testing {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
#### Overview {.body}

The maintainer **shall** review each contribution to ensure that all tests pass,
the contribution works as expected without introducing errors.

#### Automated Testing {.body}

The maintainer **should** maintain automated tests to protext against errors.

!!! note "GitHub Help"
    GitHub allows maintainers to set up an automated test suite that runs on
    every pull request and merges into the main branch. Good automated test
    suites can help catch bugs from going into production and breaking the
    application.

!!! example
    [Is Website Vulnerable](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/is-website-vulnerable)
    finds publicly known security vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries' websites

#### Failing Automated Tests {.body}

If a maintainer receives a pull request that fails automated testing, the
maintainer **should** wait a few days to allow the contributor to resolve
the issue independently.

If the contributor does not resolve the issue within a few days, the maintainer
**shall** contact the contributor to see if they need help.

If the failing test is unrelated to the contributor's changes, the maintainer
**shall** let the contributor know that the error is safe to ignore and that
it will be fixed in another pull request.

If the contributor fails to respond after repeated attempts over several weeks
or months, the maintainer **should** close the pull request and move on.

!!! note
    If multiple contributors fail the same set of tests, the tests may need
    improvement.

![Failed automated tests](_assets/images/failed-automated-tests.png)

#### Code Reviews {.body}

Prior to accepting any pull request, the maintainer **shall** review all
proposed changes to ensure that they are designed to address the reported
issue as claimed and that they conform to the projects coding and documentation
guidelines.

!!! note
    Performing this test before manual testing is useful as it will provide
    insights into the types of manual tests that are most appropriate.

#### Manual Testing {.body}

Prior to accepting a significant pull request, the maintainer **should** manually
test the project using his local machine.

!!! note
    If a pull request involves a small change to documentation or code, manual
    testing is less important, but the maintainer is the last line of defense
    before a pull request is merged in, which can potentially introduce new issues.

### Effective Feedback {.body}

If the maintainer discovers a problem with the pull request, the maintainer
**shall** respond to the contributor with a detailed account of the problem.

!!! note
    Sometimes, it helps to include a screenshot or screen recording. If the
    automated tests did not catch the problem, it might be worth creating a
    separate issue to update the test suite.

The maintainer **shall** indicate the importance of each problem identified in
the contribution with `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`.

!!! note
    Feedback provides a public log of how an issue has been addressed and needs
    to be informative, constructive, and helpful for the reviewer, contributor,
    and others that might read it at a later date.

!!! example
    High: Please use more descriptive variable names for better readability. For
    example, revise the code to replace variable `d` with `duration`.

#### Missing Tests {.body}

Significant contributions of code **should** be accompanied with tests to help
ensure that everything is working as expected.

!!! note
    If the contribution does not include such tests, reach out to them to
    determine how they tested their contribution and let them know what parts
    need to be tested.

## Creating a Release {.body}

The maintainer **shall** create a formal release for each version of the
document approved for release by the responsible WG or committee.

!!! note "GitHub Help"

    Within GitHub, this can be achieved through the**Releases** tab.

The maintainer **shall** assign a tag to the release that indicates the version
number per [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

!!! note
    This produces a version number in the format of
    `<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-<pre-release>]` format, where

    - the `major` number increments (and the other values reset to 0) when
    non-backwards compatible changes are made,
    - the `minor` version increments (and patch resets) when features are added
    in a backwards compatible manner,
    - the `patch` increments when backward compatible fixes are made without any
    new features, and
    - an optional `pre-release` code (preceded by a hyphen) indicates versions
    under development and must have a sequential alphanumeric identifier

The maintainer **shall** attach a PDF and zip archive of the website in
versioned directories in the gh-pages branch.

    gh-pages/  
    ├── index.html (latest version)  
    ├── v1.0.0/  
    ├── v1.0.1/  
    ├── v1.1.0/  
    └── v2.0.0/

!!! note "GitHub Help"
    This can be automated with GitHub actions.

!!! note
    When deploying a new version, ensure the previous version is moved into its
    own directory before overwriting the index.html and other files for the new
    release.

!!! example "Example GitHub Action"
    ```yml
    name: Deploy MkDocs Site and Generate PDF
    on:
      push:

## Building a Community {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### Overview {.body}

A vital component of any open source project is its community. Building a strong
community can help accelerate the growth of your open source project. As new
contributors discover and start to contribute to your project, you will want to
create spaces for communication and collaboration.

If your project is on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)
as a way for contributors to post questions and facilitate conversations. WG
meetings should be advertised on the discussion board to encourage participation.

### Promptly Respond and Address Concerns {.body}

Maintainers **should** establish a schedule to review incoming issues and pull
requests and post this schedule within the discussion forum.

!!! note
    It is important to set expectations as to how fast maintenance issues are
    likely to be addressed. This timline might vary considerably across ITS
    open-source projects and during teh lifetime of any one project (e.g.,
    there are often periods of moew active development and less active
    development).

The maintainer **should** set up [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
to automate responses that welcomes each new contributor and provides an estimated
time by which the issue triage or PR review can be expected

!!! note

    You can learn how to set one up in[this article](https://dev.to/opensauced/github-actions-a-maintainers-best-friend-488n).

## Advanced Features {.body}
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### Overview {.body}

Leveraging GitHub Actions to bring Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
or Deployment (CI/CD) into your workflow directly in your repository will let
you run code, test, build, and deliver or deploy software with simple and secure
workflows. Automating these tasks will speed up your deployment process.

Using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions to build a CI/CD pipeline should give you
confidence in your code.

Below are some helpful resources to help you build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:

- [GitHub Docs: The complete CI/CD solution](https://github.com/solutions/ci-cd/)
- [How to build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions in four simple steps](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/)

There are many types of actions that you can set up for your project, depending
on what you need. Below are some GitHub Actions that you usually find across
repositories:

### Linter {.body}

Most open source repositories have linters that run on each pull request. Linter
is a tool for detecting potential errors and maintaining a consistent code style
in a project. [Super-Linter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)
is one of the most used actions. This action can help you maintain code quality
and achieve a more readable and consistent style.

### Code Scanning Tools {.body}

Code scanning is a tool for detecting security vulnerabilities, possible bugs,
and errors in code. You can use GitHub's [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning)
feature and configure tools like
[CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql),
which GitHub maintains, or third-party scanning tools such as
[SonarQube](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan).

### Creating and Customizing Actions {.body}

Actions of note:

- [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
- [Take Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/contributor-takes-action):
allows contributors to assign themselves to an issue by typing the `.take`
command in the issue's comment.
- [Triage Action](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/triage.yml):
blocks the Take Action whenever a `needs triage` or `core team work` label exists.

You can read more about GitHub Actions and how to create one in
[the official documentation](https://github.com/features/actions).

### Projects {.body}

Keeping track of your issues is getting more challenging as your project
progresses. A great tool that can help you organize and track your issues is
[Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
on GitHub. With projects, you can efficiently manage your project's features,
roadmaps, or releases as they're built from and integrated with issues and pull
requests that you add.

You can choose a template for your project. One of the templates is the "Kanban"
template. Here, you can create notes and place the existing issues and pull
requests in the "Backlog", "Ready", "In progress", "In review", and "Done"
columns. This will make it easy for you and your team to track the progress of
your project.

To create a new project:

1. Navigate to your GitHub profile and click the "Projects" tab.
2. Click the green "New project" button.
3. Choose a template.
4. Name your project and click the "Create project" button at the bottom.

Please read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project)
to learn more about adding items to your project.

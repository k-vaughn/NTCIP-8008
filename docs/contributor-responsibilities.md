# Contributor Responsibilities {.body}

## Overview {.body}

Contributions on projects using the ITS Open Source Process are always welcome,
no matter how large or small. However, before contributing, it's important to
familiarize yourself with the following resources of the project:

Some of this information is standardized in this document, but specific projects
can extend or make exceptions to the process and will always have their own
project-specific goals. Contributors are responsible for being familiar with the
information contained in the following project files, as stored in the project's
root directory:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the specific project,
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Identifies the code of conduct for the project, and
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Identifies project-specific rules for contributing.  

For projects following the ITS Open-Source Process, the last two files will
typically only identify exceptions or extensions to the rules defined by this
document.

The overall process for contributing to an ITS open-source project is shown in
Figure 4-1 and described in the remainder of this section.

## Prerequisites {.body}

### Join the relevant working group {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **should** join the relevant working group.

!!! note
    Most projects using the ITS Open-Source Process are led by working
    groups (WGs) within standards development organizations (SDOs). The lead WG
    and SDO is typically identified within the README file in the root directory
    of the project repository. Contributors are strongly encouraged to join the
    corresponding working group to promote better communication among community
    members and to develop a common vision for the project.

!!! example
    The ITS Open-Source Process project is led by the Base Standards and
    Profiles 2 (BSP2) WG of the National Transportation Communications Interface
    Protocols (NTCIP) Joint Committee (JC).

!!! tip "NTCIP Guidance"
    Within the NTCIP, any interested party can send an
    email to [ntcip@nema.org](mailto:ntcip@nema.org). The email should indicate
    (1) the working group of interest, (2) the stakeholder sector (e.g., infrastructure
    owner operator, other government, consultant, device manufacturer,
    management station developer, etc.), (3) contact information, and (4) a
    short biography.

### Install Software {.body}

#### Git {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **shall** install Git on their local computer.

#### Graphical User Interface {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **may** install a graphical user interface (GUI) for
Git on their local computer.

#### Development Environment {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **shall** install the development environment on
their local computer.

!!! note
    Git is available for all major development platforms, including
    Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Git allows proper version control among multiple
    contributors. Git can be downloaded from
    [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

    Git natively uses a command line interface (CLI), which can be difficult for
    beginners. There are a variety of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are
    available to assist with interfacing with Git.
    
!!! example
    Example GUIs for beginners include:

    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/): Very beginner
    level with minimal user interface
    - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com): Beginner-friendly with
    support for advanced Git functionality
    - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client): Beginner-friendly
    with advanced options and modern UI with useful video clips to explain how
    to perform tasks.

!!! tip "NTCIP Guidance"
    While contributors are allowed to use the CLI or any GUI of their
    preference, this document references GitKraken videos due to(1) the
    user-friendly design of GitKraken, (2) the high-quality help (including
    videos) available for GitKraken.

### Establish an Account on the Repository Hosting Platform {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **shall** fork the repository to their own account.

!!! note
    All edits are originate within the contributor's account and all
    contributions can be traced back to the contributor.

!!! tip "NTCIP Guidance"
    Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). This requires a valid
    email address but is free for open-source work.

### Fork the repository {.body}

Those wishing to contribute **shall** fork the repository to their own account.

!!! note
    The main repository is shared by the entire open-source community on
    GitHub. Individual contributors are not allowed to directly edit this file
    as that would create a chaotic environment. [Forking a
    repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
    creates a copy of the repository on the repository hosting platform within
    the contributor's account. The contributor can then edit the copied
    repository (as described below). The contributor's repository will inherit
    the visibility of the project being forked (i.e., for open-source projects,
    it will be public). This allows the open-source community to review the
    proposed changes prior to accepting their incorporation into the community
    repository.

!!! tip "Github Guidance"
    Press the "Fork" button in the upper-right portion of
    the shared repository's home page (e.g.,
    [https://github.com/&lt;account>/&lt;project>](https://github.com/&lt;account>/&lt;project>)).
    For complate details, see the [Fork a
    Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
    article on GitHub help.

### Clone the repository {.body}

The contributor **shall** clone (i.e., copy an instance of) the forked
repository to the local machine where edits are to be made.

!!! note
    While a fork creates a copy on the host platform (which can be viewed
    by others), [cloning your forked
    repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)
    creates a copy of your forked repository on a local machine. This allows the
    contributor to edit files on a local machine rather than directly in the
    online environment.

!!! tip "GitKraken Guidance"
    - [GitKraken Guidance](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/open-clone-init/#cloning-an-existing-project)

### Claim an Issue {.body}

Before starting on any changes to the project, a contributor **shall** claim an
associated issue.

A contributor **shall** not claim an issue that has the label "triage".

A new contributor to a project **may** claim an issue tagged as [good first
issue](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
or [beginners
only](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginners+only%22).

Experienced contributors **shall not** claim issues tagged with the label
"beginners only".

Experienced contributors **should** avoid issues tagged with the label "good
first issue".

!!! note
    Taking ownership of an issue:

    - Notifies maintainers that work is starting to address the issue,
    - Allows efficient communication by allowing the maintainers and 
    contributor to discuss the issue and proposed changes early in the update cycle,
    - Provides a historical record of the steps taken to address the issue,
    - Helps to block inappropriate pull requests as any pull request without an 
    associated issue can be easily rejected. 

    When you're new to a project, it's a good idea to start with small, 
    manageable tasks, fixing bugs, adding tests, or updating documentation. 
    These will often be tagged with the text "good first issue" or 
    "beginners-only". This will help you become familiar with the material and 
    development workflow without getting overwhelmed.  The goal is to reserve 
    at least some of these issues for new contributors or until the end of the 
    project; if everyone solves these problems first, it makes it more 
    challenging for contributors to gain experience.

!!! tip "GitHub Guidance"
    If an issue is not assigned and it is not labeled with
    "triage", it is generally assumed to be available for anyone to work on.
    Take control of the issue by submitting a comment of `.take` on the selected
    issue). When an issue is assigned, it will be indicated under the
    "Assignees" section of the issue.

    ![Issue assignees section on GitHub](_assets/images/issue-assign.png)

!!! note
    Projects can implement additional rules regarding the assignment of
    issues. Always review the project's contributing guidelines to ensure you are
    aware of any variations from this standard process.

!!! tip
    If you get stuck while working on your changes or need other
    clarification, you can always ask for help using the discussions tab of the
    project. For example, you can get help for the ITS Open-Source Process
    project at the [Discussion
    Tab](https://github.com/ite-org/intro/discussions).

### Create a Branch {.body}

Prior to starting work on a claimed issue, the contributor **shall** create a
separate branch for all edits related to that singlular issue.

!!! note
    Creating a separate branch facilitates tracking of changes and allows
    easier roll-backs of the project to known states.  

### Make Edits {.body}

Once the contributor has claimed an issue and has a branch devoted to the
development of that issue, the contributor **shall** make changes in the local
branch according to project guidelines.

!!! note
    Annex B, C, and D provide preferred guidelines that can be referenced
    for different types of contributions.

    If you have questions or concerns during the process (especially between
    meetings of the corresponding WG), you can use the Discussions tab
    associated with the project. These forums can be very useful in knowledge
    sharing and forming consensus, however, users should be aware that the
    discussions tab does not represent official decisions of the WG.

!!! tip
    Avoid addressing any other issues as this (1) makes the change larger and
    delays completion of your primary task, (2) can overlap with changes being
    made by others, and (3) complicates version control by not clearly
    documenting when specific changes were made.
    However, in some cases, it may be appropriate to address multiple small and
    similar issues at once. For example, multiple grammar issues in
    documentation can be grouped into a single pull request.

### Pull and Merge Updates {.body}

Prior to submitting a PR, the contributor **shall** pull the latest updates
incorporated into the shared project and merge these updates into the
contributor's working branch.

!!! note
    Because multiple contributors can be working on the same project
    simultaneously, care must be taken to ensure that each contributor has the
    latest version of files prior to proposing their changes to be incorporated
    into the shared repository. This is done by first pulling any changes from
    the shared repository into the contributor's forked version and then pulling
    those changes down into the contributor's local branch. During this process,
    the Git environment will highlight any conflicts (e.g., if the contributor
    and someone else changed the same line of the same file). When this occurs,
    the contributor will need to resolve each conflict prior to finalizing the
    merge.

!!! note "GitHub Help"
    To update your local copy, first update your forked (origin) repository:

    Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    Click the "Sync fork" button.
    Click the green "Update branch" button.

    Next, pull the latest changes in the main branch in the origin repository to
    update your local working branch by following these steps in your terminal:

    `git checkout YOUR-BRANCH-NAME`

    `git pull origin main`

### Test the Updates {.body}

After pulling and merging the latest updates but prior to submitting the PR, the
contributor **shall** install any necessary dependencies and test the changes to
ensure that the changes provide the intended operation without any new bugs.

!!! note
    It is critical that updates are tested prior to being incorporated into the
    final code (this includes ensuring that documentation files render correctly).
    Specific projects can define their own testing process and procedures.
    You can find the instructions on how to run a project locally in the README
    file or in the contributing guidelines.

### Commit the Update {.body}

Prior to pushing the proposed changes to online repository, the contributor
**shall** commit the changes in the working directory.

The contributor **may** perform interim commits during the development of the
proposed changes.

The contributor **shall** use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification for structuring commit messages.

Here are some examples of Conventional Commit messages:

    feat: add password reset functionality
    docs: update installation instructions
    chore(build): update dependencies
    fix(login): resolve issue with incorrect password validation
    refactor(api): streamline error handling in user service

!!! note
    Committing changes ensures that the changes are logged in the contributor's
    local git account and is required prior to pushing the material to the
    contributor's online copy.

### Push the Update to Contributor's Online Repository {.body}

Once the contributor has completed the proposed revisions and has created a
local commit, the contributor **shall** push the proposed changes to the
contriutor's online repository.

!!! note
    The changes need to be posted to the online repository so that other
    users can review the changes prior to their incorporation into the shared
    repository.

### Make Pull Request {.body}

Once the contributor has completed the above steps, the contributor **shall**
complete a pull request.

The contributor's pull request **shall** comply with the selected pull request
template for the project, completing each field.

The contributor **shall** verify that GitHub does not report any action bot or
other failures upon submitting the PR.

!!! note
    In order to ensure that changes made to the shared repository fit with
    the project plan, follow subittal guidelines, and are free of bugs, it is
    important that they are reviewed before being incorporated. As such, rather
    than allowing each contributor to push changes to the shared repository
    without any review, they **request** the maintainer to **pull** the proposed
    changes. The request initiates the review process, and if successful, the
    changes will be pulled. The request for the maintainers to pull the updates
    is called a "[pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)"
    (PR). In order to ensure that these requests are valid and useful, they must
    comply with the pull request template (e.g., identify the issue that the
    change claims to address).

    It is especially important that the PR identifies the issue that the PR
    claims to address and must prefix the issue number with "Fixes #" to ensure
    that the issue is closed once the change is accepted.
    
    The contributor will need to correct any errors that occur during the
    submittal process to ensure that the PR is received by the maintainers.

!!! warning  
    A PR may be marked as invalid and closed if:

    - the issue is not assigned to the contributor who opened the PR,
    - no issue is linked to the PR,
    - the PR template is incomplete, or any section in the template is deleted, or
    - changes are made directly in the default (`main`) branch.

### Cooperate with Reviewers {.body}

The contributor **shall** work with the review team to address any questions,
concerns, or problems that arise.

The contributor **may** appeal any direction received from the reviewers to the
parent WG.

The contributor **shall** accept the direction of the review process, including
any appeals.

!!! note
    After a pull request has been submitted, reviewers can have questions
    or concerns (e.g., failure to comply with style guidelines). In addition, if
    multiple proposals are received in a short period, last minute changes can
    cause merge errors that need to be resolved. The contributor is typically
    the person most qualified to make revisions to the proposed changes without
    introducing errors. Although expected to be rare, there can be instances
    where the contributor and reviewers have different opinions about how a
    change should be implemented. The shared project is managed by the entire
    team and the contributor needs to respect the decisions made by the full
    team.

## What Happens Next? {.body}

After your contribution has been submitted and reviewed, one of the following
outcomes may occur:

1. **Your contribution is accepted**: If your contribution is approved by the
   project maintainers, it will be merged into the main branch of the codebase.

2. **Your contribution requires changes**: Sometimes, the project maintainers
   may request changes to your contribution before it can be accepted. This
   could be due to coding issues, conflicts with other changes, or a need for
   additional documentation. In this case, make the requested changes and
   resubmit your pull request.

3. **Your contribution is rejected**: In some cases, your contribution may not
   align with the project's goals or requirements, or it may not be the best
   solution to a problem. If your contribution is rejected, don't be
   discouraged. Take the feedback you received as an opportunity to learn and
   improve. You can always try contributing to another project or submitting a
   different contribution to the same project.

## Keeping Branches Up to Date {.body}

It is highly recommended that you update your remote and local branches
habitually. That way, your branch will have the latest update when merged into
the `main` branch of the original (`upstream`) repository.

The best times to update your branches are before you push your changes to the
remote repository and while you're waiting for your pull request to be reviewed.

In general, it is preferrable to make small incremental changes to the project
and to provide the updated materials as soon as possible after taking control of
an issue. The longer the duration between checking out the project and
submitting a pull request the higher the chance that another contributor will
make competing changes in one of your files, which may need to be manually
inspected to properly merge the changes.

## Merge Conflicts {.body}

Merge conflicts are something you'll commonly encounter when contributing to an
open source project. When two branches have made different changes to the same
line(s) in the same file(s), Git cannot automatically determine which change to
keep, resulting in a conflict.

When a merge conflict occurs, Git adds conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`,
and `>>>>>>`) to indicate the conflicting lines from different branches.
Everything between the `<<<<<<<` and `=======` is the changes that you worked on
(current changes). And everything between the `=======` to `>>>>>>>` is the
incoming changes from the remote `main` branch.

You need to pay attention to the conflicts and decide how you want to resolve
them. You can keep only your change, incoming change, or both changes.

### Tips to Prevent Resolving Merge Conflicts Repeatedly {.body}

Some open source repositories, such as OpenSauced's
[guestbook](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook) and
[pizza-verse](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse) repositories, have
high contribution activities in the same files that can cause merge conflicts.

Below are some tips to prevent you from resolving merge conflicts repeatedly
when contributing to open source projects:

#### 1. Following Instructions {.body}

Ensure you follow the instructions in the project's README or Contributing
Guide, and don't miss any step.

#### 2. Pull Request Form {.body}

Complete the template form and fill in all areas when creating a pull request.

#### 3. Resolving Merge Conflicts Immediately {.body}

If a branch has merge conflicts that must be resolved, the merge button is
automatically disabled. So, maintainers are not able to merge the pull request.

When you notice merge conflicts in your pull request or if a maintainer asks you
to resolve merge conflicts, fix them immediately. The sooner you resolve the
conflicts, the sooner maintainers can review and merge your pull request.

### Merge Conflicts in the Guestbook Repository {.body}

Since the primary purpose of the OpenSauced guestbook is to add your name to
`.all-contributorsrc` and the `README.md` files, there is a high chance that you
will encounter merge conflicts.

The conflicts happen when maintainers have merged pull requests before yours
while you're working on your changes or waiting for your pull request to be
reviewed. And you need to resolve them before your pull request can be merged.

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts {.body}

Before resolving merge conflicts, you must first
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD051 -->
[update your branches](#pull-and-merge-updates). Then, follow these steps:

1. In the `.all-contributorsrc` file:

   - Click the "Accept Both Change" option on the top of your workspace in VS Code.
   - Move your profile details to the end of the contributors' array and fix
     anything necessary.

2. In the `README.md` file:

   - Click the "Accept Incoming Change" option on the top of your workspace in
     VS Code for each conflict in this file.

3. Run `npm run contributors:generate`.

   You will now see that the all contributors badge has been incremented, and
   your profile is generated at the end of the contributors' list in the
   `README.md` file.

4. Add and commit your changes.

    git commit -am "Resolve merge conflicts"

5. Push your commits to your remote branch.

    git push

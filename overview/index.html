<p>When someone identifies a need for a new shared resource (e.g., industry
standard, reusable code, etc.) within ITS, they can develop a proposal and
submit it to an appropriate committee. The
proposal can be relatively simple (e.g., a statement of goals and structure) or
a complete prototype.</p>
<p>If the proposal is accepted by the committee, the committee will assign a working group and one or more
maintainers who will become responsible for leading the project. This will often
include the individual proposing the project. The <abbr title="A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open source project. Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors. They also have the authority to make final decisions about the direction and scope of the project.">maintainer</abbr> will establish the

<p>Once the initial upload is provided, the <abbr title="A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open source project. Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors. They also have the authority to make final decisions about the direction and scope of the project.">maintainer</abbr> will work with the working
group to refine the vision for the project and establish the set of baseline
issues as a part of the project plan. The project plan will also define the
planned release schedule, which can be based on a calendar schedule, reaching
milestones, or achieving other metrics. Members of the WG are encouraged to
submit their issues directly so that the originator can be properly captured and
to encourage WG members to become familiar with the process; however, the
Maintainer can submit comments on the behalf of others, if needed.</p>
<p>The Maintainer is also responsible for creating any necessary branches for developing draft materials. The "main" <abbr title="A branch is a separate version of the code that's created for development purposes. Branches allow contributors to experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase. When changes are ready to be merged into the main codebase, they're typically submitted as a pull request.">branch</abbr> should always be restricted to formal releases. Working drafts and pre-releases should be contained within branches so that industry users do not accidentally look at a draft thinking that it is approved.</p>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">Needs Review</p>
<p>We need to review this process with a GitHub expert to determine the best way for managaing the website (and PDF) rendered versions of the current release alongside drafts. In other words, deployments need ready access to the current version (and all previous versions) while WG members need access to the current draft. By default GitHub only allows one rendered version but we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use separate repositories (e.g., NTCIP-8008 and NTCIP-8008-future)</li>
<li>Use subdirectories (e.g., <abbr title="Docs is an abbreviation for &quot;documentation&quot;. It primarily explains how to implement and use a product or an open source project.

<li>Use a GitHub action to publish different branches to different subdirectories of the gh-pages <abbr title="A branch is a separate version of the code that's created for development purposes.

<p>All projects should likely use the same mechanism and the selection should be made in consultation with GitHub experts.</p>

<p>Users of open-source projects often have questions, encounter bugs, request

way for the community to help guide the development of the project. Comments can be submitted at any time.</p>
<p>When comments are submitted, maintainers (and other followers) are notified. If

<p>Each project should identify its goals for triaging submitted issues. By default, projects should have a goal of triaging all comments within one month of their submittal, but the exact timeline might vary based on available resources, the criticality of the project, and other factors. If a submitted <abbr title="An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code.

<p>Open-source projects encourage contributions from the community, allowing others
to solve issues or implement features. Contributors gain experience and
recognition, while the project benefits from a broader range of solutions.</p>
<p>Interested contributors browse the list of open issues, claim one they are
interested in, and start working on a solution. When they have develped and
tested their proposed solution, they submit a request for the <abbr title="A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open source project.

<p>Releasing a project allows users to access a stable, tested version with new
features, <abbr title="A bug refers to an error, flaw, or defect in code that adversely affects the proper functioning of the software.

Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors.

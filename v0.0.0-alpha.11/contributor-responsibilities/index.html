<p>Contributions on projects using the ITS Open Source Process are always welcome,
no matter how large or small. However, before contributing, it's important to
familiarize yourself with the following resources of the project:</p>
<p>Some of this information is standardized in this document, but specific projects
can extend or make exceptions to the process and will always have their own
project-specific goals. Contributors are responsible for being familiar with the
information contained in the following project files, as stored in the project's
root directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>README.md</strong>: Provides an overview of the specific project,</li>
<li><strong>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</strong>: Identifies the code of conduct for the project, and</li>
<li><strong>CONTRIBUTING.md</strong>: Identifies project-specific rules for contributing.  </li>
<li><strong>LICENSE.md</strong>: Identifies the license agreement for project files</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">Needs Review</p>
<p>We need to make sure that our standard license addresses all concerns. To date, it sounds as if CC-BY is a reasonable approach for documentation and BSD 3 clause is acceptable for code. MIBs probably need a custom license that falls in between these two and restricts the types of changes and use.</p>
</div>
<p>For projects following the ITS Open-Source Process, the last two files will
typically only identify exceptions or extensions to the rules defined by this
document.</p>
<p>The overall process for contributing to an ITS open-source project is shown in
Figure 4-1 and described in the remainder of this section.</p>

at least some of these issues for new contributors or until the end of the

<li>installing the dependencies</li>
<li>setting up the environment variables</li>

<p>The best way to test your guide is by setting up the project locally using your guide.
If you encounter issues getting your project to work, you will discover it quickly
and can update the documentation to add or clarify the missing piece.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you repeatedly write the same reply to issues or pull requests. Clear

with the same comments.</p>

<p>It is important to set expectations as to how fast maintenance issues are
likely to be addressed. This timline might vary considerably across ITS
open-source projects and during teh lifetime of any one project (e.g.,
there are often periods of moew active development and less active
development).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open source project. Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors. They also have the authority to make final decisions about the direction and scope of the project.">maintainer</abbr> <strong>should</strong> set up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>
to automate responses that welcomes each new <abbr title="A contributor is anyone who makes changes, additions, or suggestions to an open source project. Contributors can be developers, designers, writers, testers, or anyone else who helps to make the project better.">contributor</abbr> and provides an estimated
time by which the <abbr title="An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code. Issues can be created by anyone, and they're often used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks that need to be done.">issue</abbr> triage or PR review can be expected</p>

<p>Leveraging GitHub Actions to bring Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
or Deployment (CI/CD) into your workflow directly in your <abbr title="A repository is a central location where code is stored and managed. In open source, repositories are often hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Each repository can contain one or more projects, and contributors can submit changes to the code by making pull requests.">repository</abbr> will let
you run code, test, build, and deliver or deploy software with simple and secure
workflows. Automating these tasks will speed up your deployment process.</p>
<p>Using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions to build a CI/CD pipeline should give you
confidence in your code.</p>
<p>Below are some helpful resources to help you build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/solutions/ci-cd/">GitHub Docs: The complete CI/CD solution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/">How to build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions in four simple steps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many types of actions that you can set up for your project, depending
on what you need. Below are some GitHub Actions that you usually find across
repositories:</p>
<h3 class="body" id="linter">Linter<a class="headerlink" href="#linter" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most open source repositories have linters that run on each <abbr title="A pull request is a request from a contributor to a maintainer for changes made to the code to be pulled into a codebase.">pull request</abbr>. Linter
is a tool for detecting potential errors and maintaining a consistent code style
in a project. <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter">Super-Linter</a>
is one of the most used actions. This action can help you maintain code quality
and achieve a more readable and consistent style.</p>
<h3 class="body" id="code-scanning-tools">Code Scanning Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#code-scanning-tools" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code scanning is a tool for detecting security vulnerabilities, possible bugs,
and errors in code. You can use GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning">code scanning</a>
feature and configure tools like
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql">CodeQL</a>,
which GitHub maintains, or third-party scanning tools such as
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan">SonarQube</a>.</p>

<p>Actions of note:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Marketplace</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/contributor-takes-action">Take Action</a>:
allows contributors to assign themselves to an <abbr title="An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code. Issues can be created by anyone, and they're often used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks that need to be done.">issue</abbr> by typing the <code>.take</code>
command in the <abbr title="An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code. Issues can be created by anyone, and they're often used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks that need to be done.">issue</abbr>'s comment.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/triage.yml">Triage Action</a>:
blocks the Take Action whenever a <code>needs triage</code> or <code>core team work</code> label exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about GitHub Actions and how to create one in
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">the official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping track of your issues is getting more challenging as your project
progresses. A great tool that can help you organize and track your issues is
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">Projects</a>
on GitHub. With projects, you can efficiently manage your project's features,
roadmaps, or releases as they're built from and integrated with issues and pull
requests that you add.</p>
<p>You can choose a template for your project. One of the templates is the "Kanban"
template. Here, you can create notes and place the existing issues and pull
requests in the "Backlog", "Ready", "In progress", "In review", and "Done"
columns. This will make it easy for you and your team to track the progress of
your project.</p>
<p>To create a new project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your GitHub profile and click the "Projects" tab.</li>
<li>Click the green "New project" button.</li>
<li>Choose a template.</li>
<li>Name your project and click the "Create project" button at the bottom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please read the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project">GitHub documentation</a>
to learn more about adding items to your project.</p>

<p>This document specifies the process used to produce open-source documents within
the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).</p>
<p>The process follows general practices within the larger open-source community;
however, this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides a step-by-step overview of the process, so that those unfamiliar with
open-source processes can better understand the process and become contributors,</li>
<li>formalizes the process (e.g., by clearly defining what are requirements), and</li>
<li>tailors the process (e.g., by defining the preferred tools to be used).</li>
</ul>
<p>The process to approve the resultant product is defined elsewhere (e.g., NTCIP 8001).</p>
<p>The ITS Open-Source Process is based on the practices defined by
<a href="https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/tree/main">open-sauced</a>. However, whereas
open-sauced is written as an informative guide and describes how systems can
work; this document is written as a specification to define how the ITS
Open-Source Process will work. While still providing a discussion of the
issues; it highlights the requirements and notable options along the way by
stating each in its own paragraph and boldfacing the keywords "shall" and "may"
to clearly designate requirements and options. The
remaining text provides further guidance and can include additional options
that do not necessitate specific numbering.</p>
<p>We recognize that <abbr title="Onboarding documentation helps new team members or collaborators quickly become familiar with a project's structure, goals, and processes.">onboarding</abbr> to a new project can be challenging, especially if
you're new to open source development. Be patient, and don't be discouraged by
setbacks or mistakes. You'll become more comfortable and confident in your
contributions with persistence and practice.</p>

projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
the ITS open-source projects.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution Process:</strong> Details the process of contributing to open-source
projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
the ITS open-source projects.</li>
